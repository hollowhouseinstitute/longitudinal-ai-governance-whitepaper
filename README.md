## Overview

This repository hosts the **public reference white paper** for the 
**Longitudinal Relational Governance Framework™ (LRGF)**—a structured approach
to understanding how risk, harm, and instability accumulate over repeated 
AI system use over time.

This README provides:
- a high-level overview of the paper’s purpose
- access instructions
- governance context
- licensing and contact info

## Abstract (Summary)

This white paper argues that:
- Traditional point-in-time AI audits fail to capture emergent governance risk
- Behavioral drift, retention normalization, and escalation decay become
  *longitudinal infrastructure* that shapes system-level outcomes
- Governance risks can accumulate between incidents and go undetected
- Longitudinal, behavior-based analysis is needed for robust oversight

---

## Key Elements Covered

The white paper addresses:
- Limitations of snapshot governance reviews  
- Mechanisms of behavioral and systemic drift  
- How retention dynamics can mask harm  
- Structural risks that emerge over repeated use  
- Requirements for longitudinal audit frameworks
